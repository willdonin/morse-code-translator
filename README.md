# Morse Code Translator
This translator can encode and decode morse code messages in a few seconds. If you would like to know how it works, follow along this file to learn how. If you just
want to try it out, you can access the live application on my replit by clicking [here](https://replit.com/@willdonin/morse-code-translator?v=1).

## Rules
There are a few important rules to know prior to use this application:

- Only characters from A-Z or 0-9. Special characters are not allowed.
- If you are **decoding**, make sure you separate each dits and/or dashes with 1 (one) space.
- If you are **decoding**, make sure you separate each word with 3 (three) spaces.

## Decode or Encode
First of all, choose if you would like to encode a personal message or if you would like decode a morse code message. 
- All you need to do is to type: "encode" or "decode".

## Encoding
If you want to encode a personal message, all you need to do is to type the message like you would trype to someone.
- Remember, morse code doesn't have special characters.

## Decoding
If you want do decode a morse code message, you need to make sure you follow the rules so it will translate correctly. For every dits or dashes 
in the same character, separate each dit/dash with a space. For every word, separate with 3 spaces.
- Dits are the dot character. -> `.`
- Dashes are the underscore character. -> `_`


**EXAMPLE 1:**
- If you want to writte "sos" all you need to type is `... ___ ...`, as you can see the dits or dashes do not have spaces in between, 
but between a dit and a dash you have a single space. So this will translate to: `Sos`.


**EXAMPLE 2:**
- If you want to writte "hello world" all you need to type is: `.... . ._.. ._.. ___` |  3 SPACES  | `.__ ___ ._. ._.. _..`, 
as you can see, on this case you have a single space in between dits and dashes within the words "hello" and "world", but you have 3 spaces separating those two words.
So this will translate to: `Hello World`.

## Turn Off
If you would like to turn the translator off, all you need to do is to type "off".
